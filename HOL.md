<a name="Ex1Task2" />
#### Task 2 - Verification: Connecting to the Virtual Machine by using a SSH client ####

Now that you have provisioned and configured a Linux Virtual Machine, you will connect by using an SSH client.

>**Note:** You can download Putty, a free SSH client for Windows, here: [http://www.putty.org/](http://www.putty.org/)


1.	In the Windows Azure Portal, select the Linux Virtual Machine from the list to enter the **Dashboard**. Take note of the **SSH Details** field at the "quick glance" section, which is the public address you will use to access and connect to the virtual machine using the SSH client.

    ![SSH Endpoint](Images/ssh-endpoint.png?raw=true "SSH Endpoint")

    _SSH Endpoint_

1. Open the Putty client (or any other SSH client) and create a new connection to the Virtual Machine, using address and port from the previous step.

	![Connecting to the Linux Virtual Machine via Putty Client](Images/connecting-to-the-linux-vm-via-putty-client.png?raw=true)
	 
	_Connecting to the Linux Virtual Machine via Putty Client_

	> **Note:** You can verify the public port for the SSH connection in the **Endpoints** section of the Virtual Machine. When using Putty, make sure you enable TCP Keepalives and set it with a value greater than 5.
 
1. Use the Virtual Machine credentials to login.

	> **Note:** When completing the password, the cursor won't move

	![Logging in to the Linux Virtual Machine](Images/logging-in-to-the-linux-virtual-machine.png?raw=true)

	_Logging in to the Linux Virtual Machine_

1. Execute the following command to impersonate with **Administrator** rights.

	````Linux
	sudo su -
	````

### Exercise 2: Installing and Configuring the Virtual Machine ###

In this exercise, you will learn how to install and configure a Web Server in the Linux Virtual Machine by using a SSH client. First, you will install the Apache Web server and the MySQL database server by using Yast2 application. Then, you will configure the Virtual Machine and create an example database. 

>**Note:** If you have not run Exercise 1, make sure you have the following items ready before proceeding with Exercise 2:
  
> - A Linux Virtual Machine created in Windows Azure Portal.
> - A TCP Endpoint enabled with private port 22.
> - A TCP Endpoint enabled in port 80.
